    <h2>Federated Bookkeeping</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>Federated Bookkeeping is the technique of electronically linking two more bookkeeping systems,
      in such a way that accounts, purchase orders, invoices, tax statements, etc. stay in sync without
      the need to go through the traditional export and send process at one system, followed by the receive
      and import process at the other system.
    </p>
    <h3>Implementations</h3>
    <p>The MoneyPane which is part of Solid OS is a first implementation of a simplistic bookkeeping system
      that supports Federated Bookkeeping. It is still under construction. The design consists of several
      components:
      <ul>
        <li>Ledger, using Synchronized Network Accounting Protocol (SNAP)</li>
        <li>Purchase Orders</li>
        <li>Invoices</li>
      </ul>
